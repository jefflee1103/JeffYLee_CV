	abstract = {Despite an unprecedented global research effort on SARS-CoV-2, early replication events remain poorly understood. Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with increased transmission, there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral replication and transcription. We used single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95\% detection efficiency, while simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes, subgenomic RNAs, and viral proteins. Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases. Moreover, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between cells, with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly, the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to its higher transmissibility with important clinical implications.},

	abstract = {While post-transcriptional control is thought to be required at the periphery of neurons and glia, its extent is unclear. Here, we investigate systematically the spatial distribution and expression of mRNA at single molecule sensitivity and their corresponding proteins of 200 YFP trap lines across the intact Drosophila nervous system. 97.5\% of the genes studied showed discordance between the distribution of mRNA and the proteins they encode in at least one region of the nervous system. These data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is very common, helping to explain the complexity of the nervous system. We also discovered that 68.5\% of these genes have transcripts present at the periphery of neurons, with 9.5\% at the glial periphery. Peripheral transcripts include many potential new regulators of neurons, glia, and their interactions. Our approach is applicable to most genes and tissues and includes powerful novel data annotation and visualization tools for post-transcriptional regulation.},

	abstract = {The polarization of cells often involves the transport of specific mRNAs and their localized translation in distal projections. Neurons and glia both contain long cytoplasmic processes with important functions. mRNA localization has been studied extensively in neurons, but very little in glia, especially in intact nervous systems. Here, we predicted 1,700 localized Drosophila glial transcripts by extrapolating from our meta-analysis of 8 existing studies characterizing the localized transcriptomes and translatomes of synaptically-associated mammalian glia. We tested these predictions in glia of the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila larvae and found that localization to mammalian glia is a strong predictor of mRNA localization of the high confidence Drosophila homologues. We further showed that some of these localized transcripts are required in glia for plasticity of the neuromuscular junction synapses. We conclude that peripheral glial mRNA localization is a common and conserved phenomenon and propose that it is likely to be functionally important.},
