	abstract = {Evidence suggests that the stress hormones glucocorticoids (GCs) can cause cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration. Previous studies have found GCs facilitate physiological synapse weakening, termed long-term depression (LTD), though the precise mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood. Here we show that GCs activate glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a kinase crucial to synapse weakening signals. Critically, this ultimately leads to phosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau, specifically at the serine 396 residue, and this is a causal factor in the GC-mediated impairment of synaptic function. These findings reveal the link between GCs and synapse weakening signals, and the potential for stress-induced priming of neurodegeneration. This could have important implications for our understanding of how stress can lead to neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {During Drosophila and vertebrate brain development, the conserved transcription factor Prospero/Prox1 is an important regulator of the transition between proliferation and differentiation. Prospero level is low in neural stem cells and their immediate progeny, but is upregulated in larval neurons and it is unknown how this process is controlled. Here, we use single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridisation to show that larval neurons selectively transcribe a long prospero mRNA isoform containing a 15 kb 3′ untranslated region, which is bound in the brain by the conserved RNA-binding protein Syncrip/hnRNPQ. Syncrip binding increases the stability of the long prospero mRNA isoform, which allows an upregulation of Prospero protein production. Adult flies selectively lacking the long prospero isoform show abnormal behaviour that could result from impaired locomotor or neurological activity. Our findings highlight a regulatory strategy involving alternative polyadenylation followed by differential post-transcriptional regulation.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.},

	abstract = {Inherited genetic factors can influence the severity of COVID-19, but the molecular explanation underpinning a genetic association is often unclear. Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.},
